The official code inplementation for "Can Modern LLMs Act as Agent Cores in Radiology Environments?"

[ArXiv Version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09529)

This paper aims to investigate the pre-requisite question for building concrete radiology agents which is, **"Can modern LLMs act as agent cores in radiology environments?"**

To investigate it, we introduce **RadABench** with three-fold contributions: 
1. We present **RadABench-Data**, a comprehensive synthetic evaluation dataset for LLM-based agents, generated from an extensive taxonomy encompassing 6 anatomies, 5 imaging modalities, 10 tool categories, and 11 radiology tasks. 
2. We propose **RadABench-EvalPlat**, a novel evaluation platform for agents featuring a prompt-driven workflow and the capability to simulate a wide range of radiology toolsets.
3. We assess the performance of 7 leading LLMs on our benchmark from 5 perspectives with multiple metrics.
